I have broad research interests at the intersection of programming languages and software engineering. I am particularly interested in better understanding of the factors that influence the usability of reusable software components. I completed my PhD in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon in December 2013. My dissertation focused on the usability of software libraries with ordering constraints (API protocols). I was advised by Jonathan Aldrich. I graduated from Brandeis University in 2004 and worked for almost four years as a software engineer before starting graduate school. I'm married to Kira Sunshine, and we have we have three children, Akiva, Elisheva, and Tamir.",http://www.hcii.cmu.edu//people/joshua-sunshine,/people/joshua-sunshine
