RESPONSE,Kayhan Batmanghelich,,"Assistant Professor, Department of Biomedical Informatics and Intelligent Systems, University of Pittsburgh",Machine Learning,http://www.ml.cmu.edu/people/people-images/batmanghelich_kayhan.jpg,http://people.csail.mit.edu/kayhan/,"My research is at the intersection of medical vision (medical image analysis), machine learning, and bioinformatics. I develop algorithms to analyze and understand medical images along with genetic data and other electrical health records such as the clinical report. For example, I have developed a probabilistic model to extract information from brain images (Magnetic Resonance Images) of patients with Alzheimer's disease and relate them the underlying genetic markers involved in the disease. I am interested in novel method development as well as real-world clinical applications.",,people-images/batmanghelich_kayhan.jpg
