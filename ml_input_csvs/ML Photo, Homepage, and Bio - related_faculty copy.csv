RESPONSE,Alfred Blumstein,,University Professor,Machine Learning,http://www.ml.cmu.edu/people/people-images/blumstein.jpg,http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-profiles/faculty-details/index.aspx?faculty_id=9,"Professor Blumstein's research over the past twenty years has covered many aspects of criminal justice phenomena and policy, including crime measurement, criminal careers, sentencing, deterrence and incapacitation, prison populations, flow through the system, demographic trends, juvenile violence and drug-enforcement policy. He is also director of the National Consortium on Violence Research (NCOVR), a multi-university initiative funded by the National Science Foundation and headquartered at the Heinz School.",people-images/blumstein.jpg
,Hartmut Geyer,,Assistant Professor,Machine Learning,http://www.ml.cmu.edu/people/people-images/geyer115.jpg,http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hgeyer,"Dr. Geyer's research focuses on the principles of legged dynamics and control, their relation to human neuromuscular control, and resulting applications in humanoid and rehabilitation robotics.",people-images/geyer115.jpg
,Joel Greenhouse,,Professor,Machine Learning,http://www.ml.cmu.edu/people/people-images/greenhouse115.jpg,http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~joel/,"Professor Greenhouse has had a long standing interest in the development and application of Bayesian methods for the design and analysis of studies in the biomedical and biobehavioral sciences, particularly clinical trials and meta-analysis. An area of continuing interest has been the use of robust Bayesian methods for sensitivity analysis.",people-images/greenhouse115.jpg
,Alex Hauptmann,,Project Leader - Informedia,Machine Learning,http://www.ml.cmu.edu/people/people-images/hauptmann_WEB.jpg,http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/alex/www/HomePage.html,"Dr. Hauptmann has done research in speech recognition, speech synthesis, speech interfaces and natural language processing. Dr. Hauptmann's research interests are to utilize large corpora of found data, or other sources of knowledge that are already exist to improve speech and natural language processing by exploiting advantages across different modalities.",people-images/hauptmann_WEB.jpg
,Brian Junker,,Professor,Machine Learning,http://www.ml.cmu.edu/people/people-images/Junker_WEB.jpg,http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~brian/,"Dr. Junker's research has focused on latent variable models employed in the design and analysis of standardized tests, small-scale experiments in psychology and psychiatry, and large scale educational surveys such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Recently he has been working on exploiting the structure of latent variable models in educational data mining applications, especially with respect to online computer based tutoring systems.",people-images/Junker_WEB.jpg
,Marcel Just,,"Professor, Director CCBI",Machine Learning,http://www.ml.cmu.edu/people/people-images/Just_WEB.jpg,http://www.psy.cmu.edu/faculty/just/index.html,"Dr. Just's research uses brain imaging (fMRI) to examine how a network of brain areas activates during the performance of language comprehension, spatial thinking and problem-solving tasks. The data consist of a time series of the activation levels of about 20,000 brain voxels, sampled once every second. I work at the Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging. I have a long-standing collaboration with Tom Mitchell which applies machine-learning (pattern-based-classification) approaches to brain activation data in various language-related types of thinking.",people-images/Just_WEB.jpg
,Jay Kadane,,Professor Emeritus,Machine Learning,http://www.ml.cmu.edu/people/people-images/kadane_WEB.jpg,http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~kadane/,"Dr. Kadane's research interests include both foundations of statistical inference and applications. His foundational work (joint with Mark Schervish and Teddy Seidenfeld) centers on understanding the consequences of extending the usual countably additive version of probability to allow merely finitely additive probabilities as well, and on finding an adequate theory of optimal group decision-making under uncertainty. His current applied work touches on law, medicine, internet security, marketing, physics and phylogenetics.",people-images/kadane_WEB.jpg
