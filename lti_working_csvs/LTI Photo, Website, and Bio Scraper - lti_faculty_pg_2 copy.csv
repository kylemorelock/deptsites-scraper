RESPONSE,Graham Neubig,gneubig@cs.cmu.edu,Assistant Professor,Language Technologies Institute,http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/sites/default/files/styles/directory_thumb/public/neubig-headshot-2016.jpg?itok=gIMBfad3,http://www.phontron.com/,"My research is concerned with language and its role in human communication. In particular, my long-term research goal is to break down barriers in human-human or human-machine communication through the development of natural language processing (NLP) technologies. This includes the development of technology for machine translation, which helps break down barriers in communication for people who speak different languages, and natural language understanding, which helps computers understand and respond to human language. Within this overall goal of breaking down barriers to human communication, I have focused on several aspects of language that both make it interesting as a scientific subject, and hold potential for the construction of practical systems.Advances in core NLP technology: Human language is complex and nuanced, and handling this complexity in a computational way requires sophisticated algorithms or learning techniques, the development of which is far from a solved problem. The first major area of my work focuses on advances in core NLP technology, which improve the accuracy with which we can analyze, translate, generate, or reply to textual inputs.Models of language associated with other modalities: Human language does not exist in a vacuum, and is often associated with context from the world around it. The second thread of my research focuses on models of natural language associated with other modalities, tackling the problems, and exploiting the fascinating possibilities presented by having text associated with other types of information. Specifically, I have worked extensively with speech, and am also interested in associations between natural and formal languages such as source code.Learning from naturally occurring data: Language data exists in abundance, particularly due to the advent of the internet, and it is possible to acquire extremely large amounts of this data for scientific or engineering purposes. A third thread of my research focuses on learning NLP models from naturally occurring data through the use of unsupervised, semi-supervised, or active learning, which allows us to exploit this data to improve models while reducing the necessity for costly manual annotation.",http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/222217661/graham-neubig

In order to pursue these goals, I invoke approaches from computational discourse analysis and text mining, conversational agents, and computer-supported collaborative learning. I ground my research in the fields of language technologies and human-computer interaction, and am fortunate to work closely with students and post-docs from the LTI and the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, as well as to direct my own lab, TELEDIA. My group’s highly interdisciplinary work, published in 160 peer-reviewed publications, is represented in the top venues in five fields: language technologies, learning sciences, cognitive science, educational technology and human-computer interaction.An exciting direction of my group's work is spearheading a satellite working group to support social interaction for learning in MOOCs with EdX called DANCE. My research toward this end has birthed and substantially contributed to the growth of two thriving interrelated research areas: automated analysis of collaborative learning processes and dynamic support for collaborative learning. Both areas use intelligent conversational agents to support collaborative learning in a context-sensitive way.All of my work draws insight from rich theoretical models from sociolinguistics and discourse analysis, and pares them down to precise operationalizations that capture the most important essence for achieving impact. I always start by investigating how conversation works and formalizing this understanding in models that are precise enough to be reproducible and that demonstrate explanatory power in connection with outcomes with real-world value. The next step is to adapt, extend and apply machine learning and text mining technologies that leverage this deep understanding to build computational models capable of automatically applying these constructs to naturally occurring language interactions. Finally, with the technology to automatically monitor naturalistic language communication in place, we can build interventions with real-world benefits.This approach leads to three aspects included in each project:",http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/15517/carolyn-rose

While this will likely take several decades, in the shorter term we've selected high-value epidemiological forecasting targets like influenza and dengue that we can work with. We've created forecasting methods for them, established metrics for measuring and tracking forecasting accuracy, estimated our forecasting limits for each target, and identified new data sources to support that forecasting goal. We are part of the multi-university MIDAS research group.Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D)We work in a subfield of this research area, in what we've termed spoken language technologies for development (SLT4D). As part of this work, we're finding ways to use spoken language technologies — like automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis and human-machine dialog systems — to aid socio-economic development around the world.Our current project, Polly, uses a telephone-based viral entertainment service to reach low-literacy people in Pakistan and India. Polly familiarizes individuals with speech interfaces and introduces them to development-related services. First deployed in Lahore in May 2012, Polly reached more than 165,000 users all over Pakistan and fielded more than 2.5 million calls in eight months. In 2013 we launched Polly in Bangalore, India, and it spread virally to West Bengal, New Delhi and other areas of India. As of March 2015, we are collaborating with the US embassy in Conakry to deploy Polly in Guinea, where we hope to achieve person-to-person spreading of approved public health messages about Ebola in many languages. A previous project, HealthLine, investigated using a telephone-based automated dialog system for access to healthcare information by low-literate community health workers in Pakistan.",http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/15426/roni-rosenfeld

I am currently interested in the following problems:Implicit Learning : Human-computer interaction generates information that the system could use to modify its behavior. For example, a speech recognition error that is repaired leaves information about a misclassification that could be used to improve subsequent accuracy. Exploiting such situations (and in fact contriving to create them) can provide a rich set of experiences that drive self-improving systemsAutomatic detection and recovery from error: Humans easily detect and recover from breakdowns in communication. Automatic systems are less successful at this, however we can use features of recognition, understanding and dialog to predict the likelihood of misunderstanding at a given point in an interaction, and then apply heuristic strategies for guiding the conversation back onto track.A theory of language design for speech-based interactive systems: Speech-mode communication predisposes the user to make certain word choices and to exhibit certain grammatical preferences. An understanding of the principles that underlie these preferences (and how these can be influenced by the system's language) leads to better language design for interactive systems.The role of speech in the computer interface: Speech is an effective means of communication, but it is not always suitable for all types of interaction. Ideally we can analyze an interface in terms of the task(s) it will be used for, the costs of specific interactions and the value perceived by the user. To date we've studied models based on time, system error and task structure. These models turn out to be useful for simple systems and appear to be extensible to more complex systems.Many of these issues are being explored in the context of working systems, for example a language interface for a team of humans and robots working together (Treasure Hunt) or a information access for conferences (ConQuest) or for scheduling court time (Let’s Play).",http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/15390/alexander-rudnicky

At present I am most actively working on topics related to automatic speech recognition and signal processing in the auditory system. I have also been involved in projects in the areas of biomedical instrumentation, particularly with regard to the auditory system, physical acoustics, computer music, and computer-aided instructional systems.Automatic Speech Recognition.   The SCS speech group is developing speech technology that can perform unlimited-vocabulary speech recognition on a speaker-independent basis under difficult acoustical conditions. We are also developing practical applications that make use of spoken language interfaces to perform useful tasks.The major goal of my own work speech research is to enable CMU's SPHINX recognition system to become as robust to changes in acoustical environment and ambience as it is to changes in speaker. In particular, we must deal with problems in recognition accuracy resulting from additive noise sources, background music, competing talkers, change of microphone, and room reverberation. We are developing several different types of solutions for these problems including improved noise cancellation and speech normalization methods, the use of representations of the speech waveform that are based on the processing of sounds by the human auditory system, and the use of arrays of microphones to improve signal-to-noise ratio. In previous knowledge-based speech-recognition systems I had also worked on statistical classification, speaker adaptation, and the integration of syntactic, grammatic, and semantic information.Signal Processing in the Auditory System.   The general goal of this research has been to develop a better understanding of how the auditory system processes sound, to apply this knowledge to the treatment of various kinds of hearing impairments, and to apply this knowledge to the development of more robust speech recognition systems. I am presently carrying out psychoacoustical measurements of various aspects of monaural and binaural perception, and developing models based on communications theory and linear system theory to relate the results of these experiments to neural coding of sounds by the auditory system. Most of my work in hearing has been concerned with the localization of sound and other aspects of binaural perception.",http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/15346/richard-stern

In the typical relationship, a human asks a computing device to solve a problem like ""compute this function"" or ""show me my mail."" From one point of view, crowdsourcing can be considered as the machine asking the human to solve a problem (""count the people on the bus,"" ""check that this prediction is correct""). In my work, I look at issues involved in crafting the crowdsourcing experience at the intersection of the human-sensible world and the machine-sensible world to solve problems. In almost every case this intersection requires machine-learning-based reasoning. I also work on main-memory databases.",http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/15876/anthony-tomasic
