I am interested in creating persistent robots that can co-existwith humans in shared environments, learning to improve themselves overtime through continuous training, exploration, and interactions. Towardthis general goal, I am currently focusing on the translation ofinformation among vision, language, and planning so that robots can 1)perceive better by fusing with verbal information provided by humans, 2)describe what they have observed in natural language, 3) generate semanticnavigation plans by following complex directions, 4) learn to navigate in asocially compliant way, and 5) explain their past, current, and futureactions and plans. As for the communication modalities for robots, I amprimarily interested in verbal (text or speech) communication in naturallanguage, but I am also interested in alternative ways for robots toexpress what goes on in their internal states, e.g., communicationmodalities studied in the arts and design community such as media arts.Currently, I am leading the perception and the learning tasks for the DARPAAircrew-Labor In-Cockpit Automation System (ALIAS) program (co-PI) thataims to bring intelligence to cockpits through semantic perception andlearning new skills from observing experienced pilots. I am also a PI onthe intelligence architecture subtask of the ARL RCTA program where myteam's work on language understanding on robot navigation won the BestCognitive Robotics Paper Award at the IEEE International Conference onRobotics and Automation (ICRA) in 2015. My newest project is the US DoD Korea MOTIE (co-PI) collaboration on robotics technologies for disasterresponse, where I will be leading the semantic map construction byleveraging text data from social media and crowdsourcing.",http://www.ri.cmu.edu/person.html?person_id=1882James Randal Sargent,rsargent@andrew.cmu.edu,"Senior Commercialization Specialist, RI",Robotics Institute,http://www.ri.cmu.edu/images/people/sargent_randy.jpg,,,http://www.ri.cmu.edu/person.html?person_id=2434Michael D.
