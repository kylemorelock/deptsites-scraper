RESPONSE,William Scherlis,,Director of ISR; Professor,Institute for Software Research,http://isri.cmu.edu/images/people/75px/scerlis-bill-75.jpg,http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wls/,"William L. Scherlis is a full Professor in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon. He is director of CMU's Institute for Software Research (ISR) in the School of Computer Science and the founding director of CMU's PhD Program in Software Engineering. Since Jan 2012 he has also been serving as Acting CTO for the Software Engineering Institute. His research relates to software assurance, software analysis, and assured safe concurrency. Dr. Scherlis joined the Carnegie Mellon faculty after completing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Stanford University, a year at the University of Edinburgh (Scotland) as a John Knox Fellow, and an A.B. at Harvard University. Scherlis has led the Fluid Project for more than a decade, which has focused on techniques and practices for scalable software assurance, leading to a family of tools for ""analysis-based verification,"" based primarily on sound static analysis but also including dynamic and heuristic analysis. Building on the use of fragmentary specifications, the project emphasizes issues of scalability, composability, and usability in the development of techniques to assure safe concurrency. Some of the technologies are commercialized through a Carnegie Mellon spinoff, and these versions have been applied to larger-scale systems including Hadoop, Java system libraries such as java.util.Concurrent, and diverse proprietary and open source systems such as app servers and simulation engines. Scherlis was principal investigator for the Carnegie Mellon / NASA High Dependability Computing Project (HDCP), in which CMU led a collaboration with five universities (MIT, USC, U Wash, U Md, U Wisc) to help NASA address long-term software dependability challenges. Scherlis has testified before Congress on innovation and information technology, and, previously, on roles for a Federal CIO. He interrupted his career at CMU to serve at Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for six years, departing in 1993 as a senior executive. While at DARPA his responsibilities related to research and strategy in software technology, computer security, information infrastructure, and other topics. He was involved in the initiation of the high performance computing and communications (HPCC) program (now NITRD) and in creating the concept of operations for CERT-like organizations, several hundred of which are now in operation world-wide. Scherlis chaired the National Research Council (NRC) study committee on defense software producibility, which recently released its final report Critical Code: Software Producibility for Defense. He served multiple terms as a member of the DARPA Information Science and Technology Study Group (ISAT). He also chaired a NRC study on information technology, innovation, and e-government, and has led or participated in other national studies related to cybersecurity, crisis response, analyst information management, Ada, and health care informatics infrastructure. He has been an advisor to major IT companies and is a founder of SureLogic and Panopto. He has served as program chair for a number of technical conferences, including the ACM Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE) Symposium. He has more than 80 scientific publications. He is a Fellow of the IEEE and a lifetime National Associate of the National Academy of Sciences."

He was commissioned an ensign through the NROTC program and subsequently attended Naval Flight Officer training in Pensacola, Florida.  While at UC Berkeley, he worked at the Lawrence Berkeley labs writing applications for organizing and displaying data from heavy ion experiments.After receiving his Navy wings in February 1980, Dave served in various squadrons and flag officer staffs, accumulating over 3000 hours in the F-14 Tomcat, and 60+ hours of combat flight time. He is a graduate of the Navy Fighter Weapons School, better known as Top Gun. His flight subspecialties/designations included being a flight instructor in the F-14, and as a reconnaissance expert with the F-14 Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS). In 1990 he was assigned as the TARPS officer the F-14 admiral’s staff at Miramar California. There he was tasked to oversee the modernization of the Navy’s TARPS’s pods, changing them from analog to digital equipment. During the period of 1993 to 1995, while still active duty, and on his own time, he studied curriculum and instruction at Chapman University in San Diego. He was awarded a Master of Arts degree in Education in 1995.  In July 1996 he was assigned to the Sixth Fleet staff to organize joint training with U.S. allies in the Mediterranean region. During this time, he led numerous projects that included providing connectivity with allied forces.In July 1998 he reported to the Carnegie Mellon Naval Reserve Officer Training Unit where he served as Executive and later Commanding Officer. He taught leadership, management, and ethics as an associate, professor of Naval Science.

I have broad research interests at the intersection of programming languages and software engineering. I am particularly interested in better understanding of the factors that influence the usability of reusable software components.I completed my PhD in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon in December 2013. My dissertation focused on the usability of software libraries with ordering constraints (API protocols). I was advised by Jonathan Aldrich.I graduated from Brandeis University in 2004 and worked for almost four years as a software engineer before starting graduate school. I'm married to Kira Sunshine, and we have we have three children, Akiva, Elisheva, and Tamir."

,Anthony Tomasic,,VLIS Instructor,Institute for Software Research,http://isri.cmu.edu/images/people/75px/tomasic-anthony-75.jpg,http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tomasic/,"Anthony's research career started with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science (with honors) from Indiana University, Bloomington. He then joined the European Computer-Industry Research Centre (ECRC) in Munich, Germany where he worked in part on the view update problem in database theory. He then attended graduate school at Princeton and performed his thesis research at Stanford University. His thesis invented novel methods for improving information retrieval search response time and throughput performance. Upon receiving his Ph.D., Anthony led a research team at the Institute National de Research in Informatique et Automatique (INRIA). His team created the federated database DISCO for data integration. DISCO was transferred to Kelkoo.com, a French internet comparison shopping site, which was subsequently purchased by Yahoo. In 1999, he participated in a team that was a winner in the French National New Venture competition. Anthony then spent three years with various internet.bomb start-ups in Silicon Valley. Eventually he moved back into research at Carnegie Mellon University where for the several years he led a team, as part of the RADAR project, that created intelligent assistants to the desktop. He has also contributed to research on extract-transform-load systems, detection of phishing messages, and scaling of database systems. In 2009, Anthony received an MBA from the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University. In 2011, Anthony, in partnership with three other faculty, founded Tiramisu Transit, LLC. His research now focuses on applied machine learning, mixed-initiative interfaces, and databases."

I'm a member of the Institute for Software Research.Prior to joining CMU, I was a postdoc in the Davis Eclectic Computational Analytics Lab (DECAL) at UC Davis, where I worked with Vladimir Filkov and Prem Devanbu. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science cum laude at Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands, in October 2014, under the supervision of Alexander Serebrenik and Mark van den Brand (here's a 10 minute video summary of my thesis). My PhD work won the Best Dissertation Award from the Institute for Programming Research and Algorithmics. I also hold a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Eindhoven University of Technology (thesis advisor: Alexander Serebrenik) and an engineer's degree in Systems and Computer Science from University of Ploieşti, Romania (webpage in Romanian; thesis advisor: Gabriel Rădulescu).On the internets I'm known as a prominent female professor from a gender studies department, that no one ever audits and that gets to peer review herself. I also suffer from cognitive dissonance."
