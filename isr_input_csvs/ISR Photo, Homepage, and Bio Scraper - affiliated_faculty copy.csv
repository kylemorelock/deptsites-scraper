RESPONSE,Randal Bryant,,Professor of Computer Science,Institute for Software Research,http://isri.cmu.edu/images/people/75px/bryant-randy-75.jpg,http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~bryant/,"Randal E. Bryant is a University Professor in the Computer ScienceDepartment at Carnegie Mellon University.  He has been on the facultyat Carnegie Mellon since 1984, starting as an Assistant Professor andprogressing to his current rank of University Professor of ComputerScience.  He also holds a courtesy appointment in the Electrical andComputer Engineering Department.  He served as Dean of the School ofComputer Science from 2004 to 2014.Dr. Bryant's research focuses on methods for formally verifyingdigital hardware, and more recently some forms of software.  He iswell known for the development of the ordered binary decision diagram(OBDD) data structure, used not just for formal hardware and softwareverification, but also digital circuit testing and synthesis, AIplanning, and combinatorial optimization.  In addition, he hasdeveloped several techniques to verify circuits by symbolicsimulation, with levels of abstraction ranging from transistors tomodels based on first-order logic.Dr. Bryant has received widespread recognition for his work.  He is afellow of the IEEE and the ACM, as well as a member of the NationalAcademy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Science.His awards include the 1997 ACM Kanellakis Theory and Practice Award(shared with Edmund M. Clarke, Ken McMillan, and Allen Emerson) forcontributing to the development of symbolic model checking, as well asthe 1989 IEEE W.R.G. Baker Prize for the best paper appearing in anyIEEE publication during the preceding year.Dr. Bryant teaches courses in computer systems.  Along with DavidR. O'Hallaron, he developed a novel approach to teaching about thehardware, networking, and system software that comprise a system fromthe perspective of an advanced programmer, rather than from those ofthe system designers.  Their textbook ``Computer Systems: AProgrammer's Perspective,'' now in its third edition, is in use atover 280 universities worldwide, with translations into Chinese,Korean, Macedonian, and Russian.Dr. Bryant spent the 1989-1990 academic year as a Visiting ResearchFellow at Fujitsu Laboratories in Kawasaki, Japan, and the 2014-2015academic year as Assistant Director for Information TechnologyResearch and Development at the White House Office of Science andTechnology Policy.Dr. Bryant received his B.S. in Applied Mathematics from theUniversity of Michigan in 1973, and his PhD from MIT in 1981.  He wasan assistant professor at Caltech from 1981 to 1984.","Randal E. Bryant is a University Professor in the Computer ScienceDepartment at Carnegie Mellon University.
